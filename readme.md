# Ask me anything

### Ô∏è[Ask a new question](../../issues/new) or [read all questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

I'm a front-end developer working at [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) in London. Before that, I was freelance for 8 years, and before that, I worked at a juice bar at the weekends and [dressed up as a strawberry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6607aTBB4).

I get quite a few emails every week asking questions that I thought might be useful to others if I answered here.

### Guidelines

- Check your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Be nice.
